## Overview
Hello and welcome to the frontend repository of the Krispyto project! Here, you'll find the client-side implementation of our crypto price analysis application. Developed using ReactJS, the frontend offers an intuitive interface for exploring historical crypto prices and associated data. The deployment is handled seamlessly through Amazon Web Services (AWS). This readme document will showcase the initial design, development, and deployment phases of the project. Feel free to utilize the following links to navigate both the website itself and the repository for the backend server.

## Design
 ### 1. Note
   - **Tool =>** The website is crafted using Figma and encompasses four main pages: the _Dashboard_, _Favorite_, _Single Currency_, and a _404 Not Found_ page. If you'd like to explore the design file, just [click here](https://www.figma.com/file/Nk8HuIRgLCIWWd8EhKHhVg/v1.0.0?type=design&node-id=0%3A1&mode=design&t=iyEJK4asJd0YfpxR-1).
   - **Font =>** Futura
   - **Color Palette =>** The color palette features Pantone Orange (#FD671E) as the primary design and favicon color, complemented by Sky Blue (#78C0E0) as the secondary hue. Pure Black is exclusively used for the font, while Fire Brick (#BF2424) communicates price drops and Jade (#00A878) indicates price rises. This thoughtful selection of colors enhances the visual representation across the website.
